# THIS PROJECT IS DEAD 
**I'll leave issues and stuff open in the miniscule chance I ever come back to this, but the code is such a mess of code I copy and pasted willy nilly back when I was stupid, I'll probably just rewrite it if I ever want to work on it again.**
# Garry's Mod: Deathmatch
A recreation of HL2 Deathmatch in GMOD. In development.

# Installing and Playing
Put the contents of the downloadable repo zip file into a file at the path **"Your GMOD install folder/garrysmod/gamemodes/gmdm"** (You will have to create the gmdm folder yourself)

Play by selecting the Garry's Mod: Deathmatch gamemode, changing server to multiplayer, and loading up a map that preferably uses the dm_ tag, eg; HL2DM Offical and Custom Maps
